1. How a FruitBT works?
(1) Start BitCometTracker_0.5.
(2) Start Seed in port 6666.
(3) Start downloading client.


Torrent seed should point to TrackerServer.

Seed should have a different PeerId with downloading client.

Seed should have a completed download tmp file and a complete file to be downloaded, also with a seed file.
