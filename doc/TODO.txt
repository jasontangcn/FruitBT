=========
1. Design how to handle the incoming and outgoing messages.
   (1) Put the incoming messages in a queue and use a separate thread to handle them?
   (2) Multiple threads to handle the incoming and outgoing messages?
       A separate thread to handle the messages of a peer connection?
       
2. Socket managing : Client will not crash because of single connection is closed.

==========
1. Exception handling.
2. Multi Threads to read messages? handle messages/send messages?
3. Logging
4.

==========
1. AliveManager close the session but a seed is download successfully, why?
2. Random strategy, Rarest First, Sequential strategy works fine?
3. Tracker response compatibility.
   e.g. BT Tracker return a plain text instead of BCode string.
4. FruitBT download file from BT seed.
   Other BT client download from FruitBT.
   FruitBT download file from another FruitBT.
   
   Make sure this cases works fine.

5. AliveManager close the connection->
   PeerConnecitonManager.readMessage-> PiecePicker.removeConnection throws NullPointerException,
   so the PeerMessageManager throws exception to Client, so fail the sytem.
6. JUnit to test APIs.

 =========
1. 8888 running a seed
   6666 try to download file.
   endless 'ready to write' and console out of memory.
   [Fixed]
  
2. 8888 running as a seed
   BitComet try to download, is failing.
   [Fixed] writeSlice bug and hash validation failed.
 
2018-11-2
=========
Added hash validation, now the implement is very rough, need redesign.  
  
2018-11-3
=========
Downloading file from BitComet& QQ downloader, check the log.
Need to design more cases to make sure the algorithm works.
  
2018-11-4
=========
Slices read/write is very rough, hash validation is just a toy, and no buffer management.

Based on internet, not local IP's.

=========
Pausing taks should not close the incoming connection?
