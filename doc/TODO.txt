=========
1. Design how to handle the incoming and outgoing messages.
   (1) Put the incoming messages in a queue and use a separate thread to handle them?
   (2) Multiple threads to handle the incoming and outgoing messages?
       A separate thread to handle the messages of a peer connection?
       
2. Socket managing : Client will not crash because of single connection is closed.

==========
1. AliveManager close the session but a seed is download successfully, why?
2. Random strategy, Rarest First, Sequential strategy works fine?
3. Tracker response compatibility.
   e.g. BT Tracker return a plain text instead of BCode string.
4. FruitBT download file from BT seed.
   Other BT client download from FruitBT.
   FruitBT download file from another FruitBT.
   
   Make sure this cases works fine.

5. AliveManager close the connection->
   PeerConnecitonManager.readMessage-> PiecePicker.removeConnection throws NullPointerException,
   so the PeerMessageManager throws exception to Client, so fail the sytem.
6. JUnit to test APIs.
